In Pakistan, cricket is the most popular game. National team of Pakistan is among the top team of the world. Large amount of people including children and women watch cricket matches.

One of the most interesting matches of my life was when our school team played the inter-school final. On November 1, our school team played the final with last’s year interschool champion team. We all were very exciting. Our team won the toss and our captain elected to bat first. The weather was cloudy that day. At around 10 pm, the match started. Our team played and scored 180 in 20 overs. It was a good innings and amazing to watch.

The second innings started after lunch. The rival team’s openers were great and scored 120 in the start. We all thought that we would definitely loss the match but turning point came when one of our fast bowler took the wicket of the opener and that was the point we headed towards victory. After that, every player contributed single digit score and their whole team was out at the 160.

It was a great victory to enjoy. Large numbers of spectators had also enjoyed the match. We celebrated our win with great fun.
