  Computer science is one of the fastest growing career fields in modern 
             history. Dating back only a few decades to the late 1950s and early 1960s, it 
             has become one of the leading industries in the world today. Developed 
             through the technological architecture of electrical engineering and the 
             computational language of mathematics, the science of computer technology 
             has provided considerable recognition and financial gain for many of its well 
             deserving pioneers. Originally conceived as an organizational solution to the 
             massive amounts of information kept on nothing more than paper, computers 
             have evolved and advanced to become a common part of modern day life. In 
             the early days of the computers age, the newest and most complex 
             computers took up no less than an entire building or very large room. It was 
             inconceivable that these machines would after only about fifty years be 
             many times more powerful and small enough to be held with tweezers 
             With the introduction of miniature circuitry and transistors, the days of
             vacuum tubes and computers that filled entire buildings are long gone and 
             the centerpiece of the today’s computer industry is the CPU, one of the 
             modern marvels of science and technology. It is essentially the brain of the 
             computer and though it is the main determining factor in the processing 
             power of the computer as a whole, many other parts of the machine are just 
             as important in overall performance. Many people don’t know this and that 
             is how computer corporations have cheated people out of their money for so 
             many years by selling them cheap systems with high megahertz numbers for 
             the processors in them. This is one reason for the success of the computer 
             industry. When people find out that they have been cheated, they will try to
